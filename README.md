# Abstract
Chummerly is a learning tool utilizing the power and convenience of using cue cards as a study technique. It brings some of the best features of competing apps, such as Anki and Quizlet, and adds more functionality and other quality of life changes. It aims to promote better study habits, more efficient learning, and more effective memorization. Chummerly requires the user to create a deck of cue cards and subsequently will assist them in learning.
The purpose of this application is to help assist the effectiveness and efficiency of a user’s studying. As cue cards have been a common study tool for a long time, many first time users will have an amazing time using Chummerly. As the application automatically applies a spaced repetition technique and significantly aids in organization, the user’s ability to learn increases significantly in comparison to traditional cue cards. This project brings the portability aspect of smartphones to traditional cue cards and advanced features such as text-to-speech, customization, progress tracking, and deck management.
